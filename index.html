     <li style = "line-height:1.3;">You only access about 5% of what you see – on a good day. Then you do a “first-fit” pattern match (not best-fit).  </li>

     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Many natural systems are better equipped to deal with high levels of uncertainty.</li>

     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Scientific method and hypothesis testing – if hypothesis is not tested in different contexts then results are of limited value.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Cobra effect. English in India tried to eradicate cobras through incentives. That resulted in cobra farms and more cobras in the end when they were released. When you announce new initiatives.</li>                     
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Hawthorne effect. Often things change simply because you pay attention to something and do novel things. Interesting example of playing around with lighting levels.  </li>

     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Loose connectivity and dark constraints.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Like dark matter or dark energy, one can see evidence that there is a constraint but you don’t know what it is. </li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Connections form and reform, mutations happen and containers may change.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Inherently uncertain. </li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;"> Complex adaptive systems are <strong>dispositional</strong>, not <strong>causal</strong>. </li>

       Napolean and marines. Concrete and tangible – not like “put the customer first” which can be re-interpeted. Commanders <i>intent</i> better than <i>precise plans</i>.</li>

   Understanding Complexity - abbreviated from HBR
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <p>
                Complexity is more a way of thinking about the world than a new way of working with mathematical models. Complexity is poised to help current and future leaders make sense of advanced technology, globalization, intricate markets, cultural change, and much more. 
                In short, the science of complexity can help all of us address the challenges and opportunities we face in a new epoch of human history.
                </p>

               <p>
                  A complex system has the following characteristics:
                </p>
                
   <ul class="arr">
        <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">It involves large numbers of interacting elements</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">The interactions are nonlinear, and minor changes can produce disproportionately major consequences.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">The system is dynamic, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and solutions can’t be imposed; rather, they arise from the circumstances. This is frequently referred to as</li>
         <p>&nbsp</p>

       <i>emergence:</i>
   <p>&nbsp</p>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">The system has a history, and the past is integrated with the present; the elements evolve with one another and with the environment; and evolution is irreversible.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Though a complex system may, in retrospect, appear to be ordered and predictable, hindsight does not lead to foresight because the external conditions and systems constantly change.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Unlike in ordered systems (where the system constrains the agents), or chaotic systems (where there are no constraints), in a complex system the agents and the system constrain one another, especially over time. 
       This means that we cannot forecast or predict what will happen.</li>

    </ul>
                <p>
      One of the early theories of complexity is that complex phenomena arise from simple rules. Consider the rules for the flocking behavior of birds: 
      Fly to the center of the flock, match speed, and avoid collision. 
      This simple-rule theory was applied to industrial modeling and production early on, and it promised much; but it did not deliver in isolation. 
      More recently, some thinkers and practitioners have started to argue that human complex systems are very different from those in nature and cannot be modeled in the same ways because of human unpredictability and intellect. 
      Consider the following ways in which humans are distinct from other animals:
     </p>
       <ul>
          <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">They have multiple identities and can fluidly switch between them without conscious thought. 
            (For example, a person can be a respected member of the community as well as a terrorist.)</li>
          <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">They make decisions based on past patterns of success and failure, rather than on logical, definable rules.</li>
          <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">They can, in certain circumstances, purposefully change the systems in which they operate to equilibrium states (think of a Six Sigma project) in order to create predictable outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

     <p>
       Leaders who want to apply the principles of complexity science to their organizations will need to think and act differently than they have in the past. This may not be easy, but it is essential in complex contexts.

        Tools for Managing in a Complex Context 
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <p>
                  Given the ambiguities of the complex domain, how can leaders lead effectively?
                </p>
                
                
                <p>
                  <strong><i>1. Open up the discussion</i></strong>
                </p>

               <p>
                  Complex contexts require more interactive communication than any of the other domains. 
                 Large group methods (LGMs), for instance, are efficient approaches to initiating democratic, interactive, multidirectional discussion sessions. 
                 Here, people generate innovative ideas that help leaders with development and execution of complex decisions and strategies. 
                 For example, “positive deviance” is a type of LGM that allows people to discuss solutions that are already working within the organization itself, rather than looking to outside best practices for clues about how to proceed. 
                 The Plexus Institute used this approach to address the complex problem of hospital-acquired infections, resulting in behavior change that lowered the incidence by as much as 50%.
                </p>
                
                 <p>
                   <strong><i>2. Set constraints</i></strong>
                </p>

               <p>
                 Constraints limit or delineate behavior. Once the constraints are set, the system can self-regulate within those boundaries. 
                 The founders of eBay, for example, created constraints by establishing a simple set of rules. 
                 Among them are pay on time, deliver merchandise quickly, and provide full disclosure on the condition of the merchandise. 
                 Participants police themselves by rating one another on the quality of their behavior.
                </p>               
                <p>
                  <strong><i>3. Stimulate attractors</i></strong>
                </p>

               <p>
                 Attractors are phenomena that arise when small stimuli and probes (whether from leaders or others) resonate with people. 
                 As attractors gain momentum, they provide structure and coherence. EBay again provides an illustrative example. 
                 In 1995, founder Pierre Omidyar launched an offering called Auction Web on his personal website. 
                 His probe, the first item for sale, quickly morphed into eBay, a remarkable attractor for people who want to buy and sell things. 
                 Today, sellers on eBay continue to provide experimental probes that create attractors of various types. 
                 One such probe, selling a car on the site, resonated with buyers, and soon automobile sales became a popular attractor.
                </p>     
<p>
  <strong><i>4. Encourage dissent and diversity</i></strong>
                </p>

               <p>
                  Dissent and formal debate are valuable communication assets in complex contexts because they encourage the emergence of well-forged patterns and ideas. 
                 A “ritual dissent” approach, for instance, puts parallel teams to work on the same problem in a large group meeting environment. 
                 Each team appoints a spokesperson who moves from that team’s table to another team’s table. The spokesperson presents the first group’s conclusions while the second group listens in silence. 
                 The spokesperson then turns around to face away from the second team, which rips into the presentation, no holds barred, while the spokesperson listens quietly. 
                 Each team’s spokesperson visits other tables in turn; by the end of the session, all the ideas have been well dissected and honed. 
                 Taking turns listening in silence helps everyone understand the value of listening carefully, speaking openly, and not taking criticism personally.
                </p> 
                
  
                <strong><i>5. Manage starting conditions and monitor for emergence</i></strong>
                </p>

               <p>
Because outcomes are unpredictable in a complex context, leaders need to focus on creating an environment from which good things can emerge, rather than trying to bring about predetermined results and possibly missing opportunities that arise unexpectedly. 
                 Many years ago, for instance, 3M instituted a rule allowing its researchers to spend 15% of their time on any project that interested them. One result was a runaway success: the Post-it Note.
                </p> 
                
                
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
     
     
 </ul>
